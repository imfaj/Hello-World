### Adding a MD Document
First, you have to create the .md file. This file must be in the  "docs" folder. <br/>
It is important to add an id and a title at the start of the file, like this: <br/>
```

id: WriteIdHere
title: WriteTitleHere
---
```
<br/>

After this, go to the *sidebars.js* file (inside *my-website* folder)
